:::note
The majority of the API routes found on this page are designed to be used within C or C++ programs,
so they may not return data that can be easily interpreted by languages such as JavaScript.

The API routes on this page **do not follow the default API guidelines** as they are internal API
routes. This means that by default, these API routes are **insecure, and should not be publicly
exposed**.

For more information on how to secure this internal endpoint for public exposure, please [follow
this guide](/docs/apis/core_internal_api/securing/).

:::danger
Exposing this endpoint without securing it is dangerous, and leaves a security vulnerability.
