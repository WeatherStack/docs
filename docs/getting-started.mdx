## Getting started with WeatherStack
You'll need a few things before beginning to set up WeatherStack. Below is a table of items **required** to be able to run WeatherStack.

### Prerequisites

| Item                        | Notes                                                                                                 |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 2 **Rasbberry Pi**s         | There'll be one that stores and processes data, and the other that you can use outside with a camera. |
| Any sensors you'll be using | Any sensors, there is a [recommended list of sensors below](#recommended-list-of-sensors).            |

### Recommended list of sensors

For a full weather station; you'll need many different types of sensors, such as: Temperture, Humidity, Pressure, Light, Wind (direction & speed), and rain.
You may also wish to have a couple others like an RGB (BGR) sensor, or a UV sensor.
For a full list of the sensors that WeatherStack supports, [please visit here](/docs/supported-sensors/).

|    Type     |                 Recommended Sensor                  | Notes |
| :---------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :---: |
|    Light    |     [`BH1750`](/docs/supported-sensors/BH1750/)     |       |
|  Pressure   | [`BME/BMP280`](/docs/supported-sensors/BME-BMP280/) |       |
| Temperature |      [`AHT10`](/docs/supported-sensors/AHT10/)      |       |
|  Humidity   |      [`AHT10`](/docs/supported-sensors/AHT10/)      |       |
|  Pressure   | [`BME/BMP280`](/docs/supported-sensors/BME-BMP280/) |       |
|     UV      |   [`GYML1855`](/docs/supported-sensors/GYML1855/)   |       |

### Setting up WeatherStack

:::tip
Before beginning to set up WeatherStack, it's recommended to read the [supported sensors](/docs/supported-sensors/) page, to see which sensors are supported, and how to wire them up.
It is also recommended to read into how WeatherStack works, and how to set it up, by reading the [WeatherStack overview](/docs/overview/) page.
